                            <h3> The Online Opportunity - CASE STUDY 1 </h3>

                            <p>
								Albert  and Gorgie are two good  friends, having their small shop in town. Both have their own shop space to help the consumer with the goods they have. With the period of time, both are doing well with their business until Albert start thinking about Online Opportunity of doing business. </p>

<p>As they are good friend Albert decided to talk to Gorgie about this online opportunity of doing business in 21st century.  Both friends decided to meet at evening to discuss Albert Idea in details.
Gorgie (after reaching on the destination) raise hand and greet the Albert and they both goes inside the cafeteria space to discuss the idea. </p>

<p>I am going to switch my business to Online Mode ! – Albert started conversion. </p>
<p>
How ? Gorgie asked , You own a small shop in a township , how you suppose to sell your service and goods to people Online. This is not for us buddy ! </p>
<p> Gorgie added in his statement and pick-up his coffee mug while laid back on chair with cross leg. </p>

<p> Dear Gorgie, You can use Online opportunity as many ways as you want, I read about this and now I make my mind. Albert replied. </p>

<p> But How you suppose to do this all? Explain me - Gorgie asked. </p>
<p>Albert order one more coffee for both and started –  </p>

<p> Listen my Dear friends Gorgie, we are doing well with business, and we own a shop and earn good in a month. But via online opportunity we can earn efficiently and  more with minimum effort or right effort. </p>

<p>Explain me more – said Gorgie. </p>

<p>Ok Listen, Albert started – How many hours you’re open with your business ? </p>
<p> 
8 hours – Gorgie replied  , or sometimes 10-12 hours – Gorgie added based on market. 
But why ? – he asked </p>

<p> Albert started – The number of hours you open your Shop is the exact time you can earn with it. Right Gorgie ? You can’t earn with closed shop! Right? – He added </p>

<p> Right! Gorgie replied while thinking. </p>

<p> So that’s why I decided to switch my business to online mode as it will increase the opening hourse of my business and I can earn more , as I didn’t shut down my shop Shutter. – Albert replied confidently.</p>

<p> Gorgie looks surprise and before he going to asked more about this – Order arrived. </p>

<p> Waiter – Here is the Order sir! Anything else sir? </p>

<p> Albert replied to No and bends towards Gorgie and say – Look its simple, we need to enter into customer shoe. We need to open our shop inside customer mobile. </p>
<p>  A business on Internet can be open from anywhere, at any time from anyone. So we have potentially more consumer leads we just need to aware more people about our business service and goods, more awareness leads more customers. </p> 

<p> I didn’t get this properly – Gorgie replied with raised eyebrows and look surprised.</p>

<p> Look we have a shop in Town, mostly those who knows us visit our store , Right? Albert asked</p> 

<p> Yes. Gorgie replied.</p>

<p> The outer area of town doesn’t know us! Infact , inside a town people who comes to market place only those know about us, those who didn’t often comes to market can purchase service and goods from anywhere. We are not even popular in our town, so what about expansion on other nearby township ? 
</p>

<p> Yeah that’s right! Average calculation says that most of the township people don’t know about us.
But why to do this all? We are going good buddy! Gorgie replied with relaxation. </p>

<p> Business is all about customer service Gorgie , and now I want to delight my customer with the Online version of shops, we aware them, awareness leads more potential customer, we leads aware potential customer to our online shop, so they can know what I offer just by clicking on internet. 
</p>

<p> In 21st century when customer already spend more then 5 hours in a day with phone – I thought its good idea to be inside on Customer Mobile with my Online Store. </p>

<p> Awareness leads customer and customer is welcome 24 x 7 via online switch. Later if they are interested they visit my store to purchase the goods or I started to take order placement Online.
We mentioned our office hours, office address and thus we can leads our online aware customer to our store! Albert finished with his explanation. </p>

<p> So , you sell goods online? Gorgie asked </p>

<p> No, I decided to first aware more people, and trying to showcase them what I did. That’s a first step </p>

<p> Later ? Gorgie asked </p>

<p> Look Gorgie I just tried to make customer more delightful, he or she can visit our store online and can see what service and product I offer to them, right now when they come to market place then only they have idea about what I did. So first step is to aware them, and then later I decided to sale my service online and also it’s not necessary that every business need to sell on Internet, its business dependent. </p>
 <p> “You can sell sugar, tea leaves , ginger online via your Online general store  but delivering delicious hot Tea at door step in minimum hours is quite difficult to do, here you can aware more people about your tea stall so that they visit your store. </p>
 <p> It’s all about business type.” -  Gorgie </p>

<p> Ohh I got it! – Gorgie replied, But what you do ? What a plan? Albert – Gorgie added </p>

<p> I am first decided to Build an Onine Presence of my Business then I decided to promote it. 
Can I also switch to Online ? Gorgie asked </p>

<p> Yes ! anyone can switch their business on Online, two weeks ago I didn’t know about this cafeteria place, and look today we had a coffee here , just because one of my friends visit this place last week and so here we are just because he mentioned the place on his Facebook Story. </p> 

<p> I see more pic of this cafeteria in their Facebook Page and can reads their Menu items directly from thier Website on Google. As I see price – I decided to visit this place as they are affordable and then via Google Map we can navigate to this place without any problem and also just because Cafeteria Owner is smart he mentioned his business on Google Map. </p>

<p> Well did you like coffee ? Albert asked </p> 

<p> Yeah ! sure , delicious – Gorgie Replied </p>

<p>So that’s an online mode of business my dear Gorgie, We didn’t come to this place as this is not much popular in town market but due to Online opportunity now we know one best place to drink Coffee with family as this place is clean and calm with better customer service.</p>

<p> Yeah Right! Gorgie added – I can see the opportunity now! Gorgie added with smile and confidence.</p>

<p>Let’s go buddy we need to Build Online Presence – Albert navigate Gorgie towards cars and they went home.</p>
