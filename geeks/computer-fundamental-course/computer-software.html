                            <h3>Computer Software </h3>

                          
<p> Computer System as you all know consist of Hardware and Software. Here IN this section we are going to learn about the Computer Software in brief. </p>

<p> Software represents the set of program which govern the operation of a computer and make Hardware run. Software are classified into two categories - </p>
<ol>
    <li>  System Software </li>
    <li>  Application Software </li>
</ol>

<p> System Software - Computer is a electronic machine and its oblivious machine doesn't have brain to do task, so for each and every task there is a requirement of a particular set of instruction named as Software to run the Machine. </p>

<p>
Hence, Software that controls the internal computer operation (reading data from Input devices , process the data for Output devices to shown them to the users, Checking system component, converting user data into binary so that machine can able to read it.) is known as System Software.
System Software are further classified into following categories - </p>
<ol>
<li>  Operating System </li>
<li>  Language Processor </li>
<li> Devices Drivers</li>
<li> Utilities or Utility Software </li>

</ol>

<p> Operating System - Operating System is the program or software work as a interface between the users and the machine.
You read more about Operating System later in this course. </p>

<p> Language Processor - Language Processor is work as the third man between Computer (or machine) and Users (Programmer). Most of the Programmer loves to code (or create a program) in HLL (High Level Language) because it’s easier to code in High Level Language but as a machine Computer doesn't understand any other language except machine language (Binary language which is 0 and 1 ).
 </p>
 <p> 
Here we need a Language Processor to make code (or program) understandable to the computer.
The Language Processor are given below - </p>

<ol>
    <li>  Assembler - </li>
    <p> This language processor converts the programs written in Assembly language into machine language </p>

 <li> Interpreter - </li> 
 <p> This language processor converts the programs written in Higher Level language into machine language by executing them line by line. One of the best things of Interpreter is that if in any line of code it find some error it report at the same time and conversion is not resume until that error will not resolve. </p>

<li>  Compiler </li>

<p> This language processor also converts the programs written in Higher Level language into machine language but the method of conversion is different. It converts the entire HLL program on one time and then report the all error along with the line number. After all error is removed then it recompiled it. </p>
</ol>

<p> Device Drivers - Device driver are very essential part or component of a computer system. You all know that Operating system is act as a link between hardware and software so that both are able to communicate with each other and perform task.
</p>

<p> A device driver or driver is a specially written program which translates the command coming from Operating system into command that the specific devices will understand. Every device has its own driver. Simply you can define it as - </p>

<p class = 'bg-dark text-white p-3 m-2 shadow'>A Device driver or Driver is a special program that allows the interaction of operating system with that particular hardware device in order to perform task. </p>


<p>Utility Software - Utilities or Utility software are those software that ensure the smooth functioning of your system. This software are developed and designed to assist the operating system to work more smoothly and user-friendly. </p>
<p> 
Some Utility software help you by backup your data, by removing virus from your system, or by recover your data which was accidently erased, etc. </p>

<p> Some Important Utility Software are mentioned below - </p>
<ol>
    <li>Text-Editor - </li> <p> Utility software used to create or edit text files. </p>

    <li> Backup Utility - </li> <p> Utility software used to back up your data or disk . </p>

    <p>Back-up means duplicating the disk or data information so that in case of any kind of damage or data-loss, this back-up data may be used. Files, folder or even a Disk can be back-up in order to prevent data from being damage. </p>

    <li>  Compression Utility - </li> <p> Utility software used to compressing the files. </p>

    <p>In simple language software which is used to compressed the size of files (large files are compressed so that they consume less storage area). When needed these compressed files are again exploding to their original size. Hence it’s useful utility software. </p>

    <li> Disk-Defragmenter - </li> 
    <p> Utility software used to minimize the fragmentation on your disk. Let me make it simple for you, see a files is fragmented when its becomes too large for your computer to store in a single location on a disk. When it happens, your computer splits the files and stores it in pieces. You can access the fragmented files but it takes your computer longer time to access these files. Here, you need Disk-Defragmenter which speed up the disk by re-arranging the files and free up the space on your Computer. </p>

    <li>  Antivirus Software - </li>
    <p> Utility software used to ensure that your Computer is free from virus or any other malware. A virus or malware is a harmful programs or software which can damage your computer hardware, operating system, or even damage or steal your data. Here. you need a good antivirus software which scan all your disk and report you in case of finding any malware or virus for resolving them and keep your system safe from these harmful software. </p>
</ol>

 <p> Application Software- Application Software are designed to perform the Specific task. Or in other world - </p> 

<p>Application Software are specific in nature, developed by computer programmer and code or instruct specifically, to perform the specific tasks. Such as - </p>

<ol>
    <li>   Railways Reservation </li>
    <li>   Processing words </li>
    <li>  Billing </li>
    <li>   Medical or Financial accounting etc. </li>
</ol>


<p> These are again categorized into 3 sub division - </p> 

<p> 1.  General Purpose Software-Only system software is not sufficient to makes a computer friendly with user. You need some more programs or software which makes your interaction with computer more easily, so that a reason we need to developed the Application software which is written for doing almost all imaginary tasks. From word processing to selecting a doctor for your friend.
As applications may be numerous if we are going to design one for each, some general software is designed for users in the manner that it suits their need and requirements. </p>

<p> Some major and most common categories are - </p>
<ul> 
<li>  Word Processing Software </li>
<li>  Spreadsheets</li>
<li> Database management System</li>
<li>  Graphics, Multimedia and Presentation Application. </li>
</ul>



<p>2.  Specialist Software- specialist application package are generally not available in shops and often you have to purchase them directly via Manufacture.
These applications are developed and designed to be used for special task such as Company payroll, Stock control systems, appointment system, e-commerce sites etc.
These are not designed for a particular company, they are developed by manufacture to provide a ease to the company employee in performing their routine task. </p>

<p> Popular Spreadsheet software - </p>
 <ul>
 <li>  Tally </li>
</ul>




<p>3. Customized Software - This kind of software are manufacture according to the user or customer requirements. These are developed as per the requirement specified by user for their personal or professional uses.
</p>
